        <h2>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens ?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class='twelve columns'>
        <p>
            Search inside Yourself define the 'please, passion and purpose'lens as : " 1.Pleasure: This type of happiness is about always chasing the next high. It is the rock-star type of happiness because it is very hard to maintain unless you are living the lifestyle of a rock star.
            2. Passion: Also known as “flow,” where peak performance meets peak engagement, and time flies by.
            3. Higher Purpose: This is about being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you."           
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This makes sense to me. I would be more prone to add a distraction phase instead of the 'pleasure' one. Indeed the rock-star high of pleasure matters, but this description makes it sounds as a sugar high to me. As a person I'll would have a tendency to push even passion related actions away if they feel too intense for my mood of the moment. I'll would lazy out and reach for an easy distraction (watching series or reading a whole book would do it), this kind of pleasure are easy to reach and do not need to meet a rock-star lifestyle. That is why I think tall the spectrum needs to be reflected in one action for it to be justifiable to hold onto for a lenght of time without guiltying on our life time spent.

        <h2>What are your core values?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class='twelve columns'>
        <p>
            I think I'll put front and foremost <em>honesty</em> as a core value. As much in toward myself and my own self care as obviously directed to others and my actions to them. 
            I would be thinking that my time is spent properly if I am spending it in care for the ones I love, or in activity that aim to create a change in society in favour of our envirronment, in rethinking sociology dynamics.

          <h2>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise</h2>
      </div>
      <div class='twelve columns'>
          <p>
            I find meditation exercises more and more effective in relaxing me and focussing my attention. As a french person in New Zealand, the future always holds some part of mystery in where it is going to take place. It is therefore much harder to picture it. 
            Resilience is a word which is coming more and more inside my world recently, I find it quite pretty.  The hability of exercing a resilient attitude in life to let oneself be happy is a great skill. I do value the relevance of defining aspects of life we want to stand for not to be too resilient in life either.

                This was a hard blog post to write and I did not give it my best thinking or came to it with full integrity because this is something I want to be able to fill as I go.
