                    On Tuesday 20th February 2018, I downloaded the app <em>Headspace</em>, to try it out. I am very interested in mediation in the idea of it and I have been retailing “well-being, meditative” products for the past year and half - but in the actual commitment to it I just struggle seeing myself becoming a daily meditator. Even if I know the benefits of it. It doesn’t feel like my lifestyle (like I know how much I love waking up early and how it makes me feel good, but I still sleep-in when I can). It maybe because, at this point, I haven’t hit the spot and I am not doing it right. Or I try to do too much when I decide to do it, instead of developing a tiny healthy habit.This is why I decided to download the app - because it engage you for 10 minutes a day and it will be a shame to let my grey matter brain go to waste when I can help it.

                    I have always been more attracted to guided meditation as having a voice feels more inclusive and binds me to come back to it. Having a planned schedule as well and a "see you tomorrow" type of relationship helps me to feel commited to it.<br>In other ways, I find myself often overwhelmed by project. Because I think they are big. The "starting small" vision resonnate a lot on what way of rethinking the steps would help me achieve them.

                    I can't really say at this point what "works", I do know that I am a creature of habit and I respond strongly to them. But I often box them to a specific period of time. If I loose my commitment to it it becomes much harder to come back to it.

                    I am definitively going to give every technique a try and see how confortably I respond to their use. I do want to take time in trying them respectively.<br>
                    The Pomodoro method and the "zone" or "flow", are the ones that are the least attractive to me as I seem to work confortably on chunks of 50 minutes. The "zone" goes as far as scaring me. It sounds more like trying to loosen mindfull focus and reflection on a subject and trust that an over-confident code writing will be brilliant at the end. From my former experience it is often a very nice feeling for me at the time but does not result in a project that is as good as it felt it should be. <br>

                    <li class='list'>Flowstate, a new view :</li>
                    <p>
                        After facing more of the concepts' documentation. I eased up on the concept of 'Flow'. Today I see it with a new side not as a overwhelming and wrongly acquired sense of power but as a sense of capability in front of a specific task. I think my former view on the flowstate was blurred by the impression of 'magic' and seeing it described as 'something just happened and I suddenly was good at doing this in a strike', like a transe state from where people would wake up, not understanding what they had done, but having done great. I saw this as a state of no consciousness and wasn't attracted to it the slightest.<br>
                        I define it today as being able to face a task to your own level of understanding and enjoyment of doing in good balance. Getting to the flowstate is more as being able to cut down a process into smaller problems that are both not too hard and not to easy (as to keep entertained and feel valuable). The whole doing should make you feel capable and powerful because on cutting task down to things you can tackle you enjoy win after wins. It could be a state of concentration as much valid for challenges from solving a puzzle piece by piece to solving a case murder clue after clue. The mix to get there is find way to have an interrest in the goal (therefore will power) and the hability in attaining it (cutting down properly to your own limitations).
