        <h2>When programming, what are some of your triggers?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class='twelve columns'>
        <p>
          I find it tough to nail down what would be my triggers when programming. I find that my triggers are more about myself and my own judgdement on how I should be doing than on a particular activity. I would be triggered negatively if I don't absolutely don't understand something on a time limit that I define myself. The thing is that especially with programming I know that I can find answers and help by Problem Solving, but I really wish I would come up with beautiful and creative programming solutions on my own all the time. I am very concious that that comes with time and practice, but so does controlling being triggered.

        <h2>What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class='twelve columns'>
        <p>
          I find that in programming I often get 'disproportionate' when I don't understand the thought process or when I find that I take too long to solve something. The disproportionate part in that is that 'too long' is very hard to define, especially in a learning process. But when I hit this road, I tend to want to put my goals aside and go to a path where I think that if I can't do it to my own standarts, I would rather not do it at all than fail. This is a negative spiral that I really want to avoid and I find that meditation did help quite a lot.

          <h2>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class='twelve columns'>
          <p>
          I find this exercise very grounding. I do think it is taking a very long time to be used today in everyday life (because it don't have enough practice) but it is very similar to replaying social interraction over and over except that in this situation there is no 'I should have answer that !' kind of reflection but more a 'This is what makes me uncomfortable'. On the long run this is more of a satifying self discovery and I think something that will help me to accept my reactions better and discover more about what triggers me.
