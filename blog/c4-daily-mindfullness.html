        <h2>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? </h2>

        <p>
            Taken from the book, I think it is important to remind myself of the three steps of the 'mindfullness conversation'
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Listening means giving the gift of attention to the speaker. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Looping means closing the loop of communication by demonstrating that you have really heard what the person is saying.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dipping means checking in with yourself, knowing how you are feeling about what you are hearing
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I practiced mindfullness listening for the first time was at 'a day at EDA', with Lianna (who is taking phase 0 as well). From this frist experience, I recall a little bit of stress as the speaker to shape my speech in a 3 minutes time lapse. I felt listened to, and it was a little bit odd to be totally ininterrupted during this whole time. From the first words to the last I had a very different approch to the subject, feeling listened to I said more about things I felt, in the type of a out loud reflection more than a conversation.
            As the listener, I felt a little bit on the edge, about being tested for the looping aspect. Wanting to remember everything perfectly, words by words more than content. I was all over the place for memo technic aspects of the speech.
        </p>

            If I think about it, I have been practicing mindfulness conversation every week since 3 years with my husband. We ask each other three questions 'What was the best thing about your week - What was the worst - Why do you love me now'. We don't time the answer but we don't interrupt the other until the three questions are all answered in one go. It is a time we connect and can think out loud about what is great, what is bad and reflect on why we are together. This is a time I always look forward, both to be listened to and to listen as well. I definitively need it to connect and I think it is necessary to be able to evolve together. 
            It taught me not to interrupt, not to preconceive what is going to come next from a sentence to the other. It taught me to give my full care to listening (without trying to solve or judge) to one person in a pre-determined moment in the week.

        <p>
            I had the feedback that Lianna felt very listened to, but my own feeling was that I was learning the information forever, more than listening / caring about it. This could have been solved by actually having the perspective of further loops after the one restranscription of speech. It would have opened the space for care more than remembering the information cerebraly.

            <h2> Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class='ten columns'>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Having a practice buddy :</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes, in the case of mindfullness conversation it is unavoidable.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Do less than you can: </h3>
                    <p>
                        I think this is something I need to consider. Maybe. I found that I like regularity in irregularity. I keep a daily practice in meditating, but I go from 3 minutes (most of the days) to 15 minutes. I already think that I am on the 'do less' side of the road. It is for the exact reason that I don't want things to become a burden, or a routine obligation. When I feel like it is a day for a 'longer' time dedicated to meditation, I allow it to myself. just according to need. Not overdoing it but absolutely not restricting it either.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><h3>Take one breath a day: </h3>
                    <p>
                        Easy. I do not want to take that into consideration too much tho. Because I don't feel like it will give me enough. I am not affraid of commiting to something to this point. In parralel to the do less than you can, I feel like I can do more. Thinking about doing only one breath a day to focus on is still something, it is great. But I don't want to be able to feel like it is ok to stop there if I can do more, I want the flexibility to be an option and doing eventually more a definite goal. I think with this one, I would be scared of feeling content with only that, but frustrated on the feeling I could/should do more.

                When I first went to Vietnam with two of my friends in 2015 I was faced with many new dishes. I am myself half vietnameese, but I stayed culinary safe wih my all times favorites until this trip. There we spent an evening ordering anything on a menu and absolutely not knowing what will arrive to our table. Some of the meals would never have been ordered if understood, but during this meal we all really decided to try the food. Like TRY the food. We chewed for long amount of time, really tasted and gave impression about everything from smell to texture, color, what we would match it with, what we recall about the last time we had it. I often think back about this time we had, and ever since I sincerely taste every new thing that is presented to me. I never thought about it as mindfullness, simply as an intense experiencing time. Reading this chapter with the chineese expensive restaurant part made me think of my own tasting and how I only think about giving my full attention to things often only on my 'first times' and let myself forget about it in the long run. I liked to be reminded that everything is new in their own little ways everytime.
