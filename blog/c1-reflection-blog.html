                I take EDA and bootcamp as a life changing experience, I don’t need only the programming learning program out of EDA, but the experience of having to code and build relationships with other,knowing how to ask clean questions to help people help you fixing problems, be able to solve other people problem’s and feel like I can become actually a software developper - with a job.

                I feel much more implicated and serious about having a plan and more “obligations” on what I am doing on my learning programming plan. I was scared about having to produce creative broad content as “Create your website on a subject you are passionate about” which is the kind of subjects that often kills my learning because I become focussed of the importance of the content of the website more than its build. Having clear questions and a defined map helps me.

                <p>
                    I have never been very much someone asking questions in learning environnement I would turn up to google things a lot. I know that I learn much less in this habit that I have. I see myself having to engage and dive into the coding culture - what I will need to find out is how to stay engaged after, and how I will keep a healthy relationship with coding problems and community.

                <p>
                    My expectations haven’t changed at this point. What I expect is to learn to learn efficiently and feel confident in that learning process.

                <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class='twelve columns'>
                <p>
                    I feel stressed about having to do the most out of this. I am so excited about the idea of taking part to such an intense learning program - which struck me nervous as well. EDA has been a huge project in my life those late few years, I developed high expectations on having to do well, and I am scared of disappointing myself.
