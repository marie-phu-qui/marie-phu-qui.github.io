    <h1 class:"title">Reflections on Enspiral Dev Academy Bootcamp</h1>
    <h2 class:"subtitle">At the start of phase 0</h2>
    <ul>
    <p><li>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li></p>

        <p><em>I take EDA and bootcamp as a life changing experience, 
            I don’t need only the programming learning program out of EDA, 
            but the experience of having to code and build relationships with other,
             knowing how to ask clean questions to help people help you fixing 
             problems, be able to solve other people problem’s and feel like I can 
             become actually a software developper - with a job. </em></p>
        
    <p><li>What are your impressions?</li></p>
        
        <p><em>I feel much more implicated and serious about having a plan and more 
            “obligations” on what I am doing on my learning programming plan. 
        I was scared about having to produce creative broad content as 
        “Create your website on a subject you are passionate about” which is the 
        kind of subjects that often kills my learning because I become focussed of 
        the importance of the content of the website more than its build. Having 
        clear questions and a defined map helps me.</em></p>
        
    <p><li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li></p>
        
        <p><em>I have never been very much someone asking questions in 
            learning environnement I would turn up to google things a lot. 
            I know that I learn much less in this habit that I have. 
            I see myself having to engage and dive into the coding culture - 
            what I will need to find out is how to stay engaged after, 
            and how I will keep a healthy relationship with coding problems and 
            community.</em></p>
        
    <p><li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li></p>
        
       <p><em> My expectations haven’t changed at this point. 
           What I expect is to learn to learn efficiently and feel 
           confident in that learning process. </em></p>
        
    <p><li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</li></p>
        
       <p><em> I feel stressed about having to do the most out of this. I am so excited about the idea of taking part to such an intense learning program - which struck me nervous as well. EDA has been a huge project in my life those late few years, I developed high expectations on having to do well, and I am scared of disappointing myself.
