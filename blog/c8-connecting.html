          <h2>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class='twelve columns'>
          <p>
            I found the loving kindness meditation rather sad in contrary to the happiness overall feeling mentionned in the book Search Inside Yourself. I directed the exercise toward my mum who is living very far away from me. As a daughter, I always find it hard to see my parents in the lense of actual living human beings. To me, they are magical creatures. But obviously no... or not too much. I find that thinking of my mum and projecting a wish for her to be free from pain, not too get harmed or sad reminded me that she could feel that.<br>
            This made me profundly sad because she is far and I know she endures me being away but does not enjoy it. I felt like I was a reason for her to be sad and that in the same time there was very little I could do to avoid it without going back to her.<br>
            I think this exercise can bring happiness as a feeling, definitively when words are chosen less heavily (like if I use "wants to be happy" instead of "wants not to get sad") and with more focus on the other person fully. I think I let my personnal feelings and blame get in the way.
