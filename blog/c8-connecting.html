        <h2> Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity?<br>
            How did it go?</h2>

        <p>
            Last year, my manager got relocated under very bad conditions, the new person had nothing to do with it, but I hated him through the situation anyway. Working in a publicly mindfull and well being centered company, my issues were heard by mid range managers and I got through a lot of thrust building sessions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            This didn't work for me at the time. Our relationship never peaked and I still think of our interractions with a little shiver of dislike down my spine. Which is a good thing to work on from this chapter. I still speak about the team we had back then with my remaining friends/collegues from the shop and I think a lot went wrong in trust and sincerity there. Our team was working a lot as a strong core united against one black sheep (not a very healthy dynamic but a uniting one for the majority of the group then) and we were then lost to an univited change which came full of power (managing director). I feel like the author got lucky from having a good person to trust and a sincere interraction. This is a motivational book and I feel like sometimes this doesn't just work out as good as that especially in the work force (as here each professionel path had a specificaly different agenda).

            I find the discurse quite beautiful and meaningfull, but also only truly applicable in situation of full control of the stakes and common goals to reach to get a win-win out of the efforts put in.

        <h2>Try empathic listening<br>
            How did it go?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class='twelve columns'>
        <p>
            I find it very tough to play around "empathic listening" without psychologising a conversation. Especially with loved ones where it is an easy derive to have the mind link a part of the monologue to a situation experienced in the past, by yourself another person or the one speaking. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I can see how important the mindfullness and especially the "feeling present" part matters heavily in this exercise.

          <h2>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class='twelve columns'>
          <p>
            I found the loving kindness meditation rather sad in contrary to the happiness overall feeling mentionned in the book Search Inside Yourself. I directed the exercise toward my mum who is living very far away from me. As a daughter, I always find it hard to see my parents in the lense of actual living human beings. To me, they are magical creatures. But obviously no... or not too much. I find that thinking of my mum and projecting a wish for her to be free from pain, not too get harmed or sad reminded me that she could feel that.<br>
            This made me profundly sad because she is far and I know she endures me being away but does not enjoy it. I felt like I was a reason for her to be sad and that in the same time there was very little I could do to avoid it without going back to her.<br>
            I think this exercise can bring happiness as a feeling, definitively when words are chosen less heavily (like if I use "wants to be happy" instead of "wants not to get sad") and with more focus on the other person fully. I think I let my personnal feelings and blame get in the way.
