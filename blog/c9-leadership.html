        <h2>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class='twelve columns'>
        <p>
          Being part of the Apache restaurant team I think the management there is a lot on the compassionate leadership. I think there is a lot of listening surrounding the life as part of something bigger. <br>
          Until this day I think the management I experienced there was the best I ever had.

        <h2>Do the multiplying goodness meditation.<br>
            How did you find it?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class='twelve columns'>
        <p>
          I found this meditation calming. I do think that I probably changed it a bit by breathing the "peaceful parts" of the world surrounding me as I struggled with terms like "the good and bad" terms. <br>
          A lot of the times the author brings the Dalai Lama goodness and life moments which looks like miracles or life changing experiences for other people I do feel a bit uncomfortable with it. I would like to still be practicing a kind of meditation but I would also want to distance myself from "miracle" workers. <br>
          Nonetheless, I found it quite similar to a guided meditation I follow on the app called Headspace, this meditation makes you think of where you are and go away from there with each breath visualizing the world around you the furthest away each time you breath.

          <h2>Do the Tonglen meditation.<br>

          I do understand why this meditation was taken out from the curriculum in the way I was commenting every step of it with a lot of distance. 
          I find the first step (toward yourself) very interresting, but I struggle to think of this meditation practice in a way that my own practice would change anything surrounding me. <br>
          I felt a bit bad about thinking of my own body as a filter of negative emotions around me and quickly got out of meditation practice. Maybe I didn't give this a fair chance. Or as noted in the book it is maybe for more advanced people. <br>
          I find sometimes that meditation practice tries to reach to people by changing their way to see the world (seeing themselves as radiating light that would ease surrounding people life for exemple)... I don't see myself like that, I don't see my practice like that. <br>
          I use meditation to calm and focus my brain when things get overwhemling, I haven't gotten to the point where I believe meditation is the tool to make myself better as a human, or the world a better place. This is partly why this practice wasn't fit for me at this point.

          <h2>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far?<br>
            How will it apply to bootcamp?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class='twelve columns'>
          <p>
            The SCARF model stands for : Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness. <br>
            I don't see too much how to apply this model to Phase 0 because I can only rely on the autonomy level of it, which was granted on Phase 0 being a one person (even if extendable to a group via Slack and Check-ins) experience. <br>
            I see this being much more of a good few concepts read during bootcamp (or anytime in life with others) to keep the feelings good and stress levels peaceful.

            <h2>Have a difficult conversation.<br>
                How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h2>
        </div>
        <div class='twelve columns'>
            <p>
            As for now I don't have any subjects that I can raise as a difficult conversation. <br>
            I read that part too late, but I recently got into a difficult subject, leading to a difficult conversation and I am pretty happy about feeling that the conversation was pretty much handled as a "Difficult conversation with insight of Search Inside Yourself practice". <br>
            It feels like the difficult conversation handling comes a lot from the "seing good will" in both yourself and others. <br>
            But I'll keep it this part of the book handy for whenever another tie comes.
