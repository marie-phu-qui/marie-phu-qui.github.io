                <h2>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class='col-md-12'>
                <p>
                    I think I really faced two phases with a different approach during this Redesign challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first, I started being a little puzzled about having to redo "it all". Obviously my website wasn't a piece of art. But looking at it everyday, twitching the CSS bits a lot to make it look clean, I got used to how it looked like. Having to think of something else, made me what to go to crazy directions. I tried out projects as gaming looks, or horizontal browsing websites, which I definitively enjoy but struggled a lot to get even to a project that would even make sense on paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, I got myself more 'together' and went through the steps of planning my websites purpose before its looks. That helped me not to be all over the place on the many cool directions the website could take.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finaly, I decided to stop on a wireframe because of the idea of <em>process over product</em>, or how I interpret it. Going through the process of experimenting how to do one design, was much more complicated than I expected. I am not even done now, but I feel like I learnt a lot, even by just copying parts of the Skeleton toggling navigation bar. To me the <em>process over product</em> helped me realize that my website is my own playground and I can move everything around as I please, and I get to learn new things doing it. I am at a starting point of my learning journey, and doing mistakes is inevitably going to happen. I realized that the immobility caused by a fear of breaking something is something I need to overcome.

                <h2>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class='col-md-12'>
                <p>
                    I know meditation to be a very nice practice - a very resting one and calming one. I personnaly use meditation from time to time to focus my attention or calm myself when I feel like my heart is beating too fast.
                    But having been the main retail seller in a meditation self well being lifestyle shop in France, I develloped for meditation a hate/love relationship. I think a lot of the sayings about being a meditator are tacky and a lot on a trendy show-off lifestyle. I like everyone to keep their individuality and I saw a lot of meditator caricatures coming to me, just to spread their knowledge. The concept of meditating as an answer to anything and having a wise and slow graps of life is not appealing to me. That is the predjudice I have about meditation.

        <div class='row'>
            <div class='subtitle, col-md-12'>
                <h2>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class='col-md-12'>
                <p>
                    I would not say that I learnt new things. 
                    But giving it a fair go, I realized that some things that I would do as to "fit in" my own view of medidation could definitively be broaden and that I was treating the subject with definitively some ressentment related to too much exposure in a work environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For exemple, I would always prefer to close my eyes to meditate. I always get distracted easily, so not having a visual distration helps. Via this chapter, I get that it is totally ok not to focus <em>*hard*</em>. So I let myself try open eyes meditation - I still feel self conscious in the practice, so being able to be eyes open is a good thing to try a little practice on a bench in a busy street - It doesn't make me rest as easily but it is another path.

            <div class='subtitle, col-md-12'>
                <h2>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class='col-md-12'>
                <p>
                    I had heard of the powerful mountain image before - it always make me giggle and I like it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the author's suggestion of a mid open eyes mediation as being the best option - I decided to try both closed (that I used to do) and open eyed meditation according to situation and this resulted in a new view of the practice that really stand out for me.
                </p>

        <div class='row'>
            <div class='subtitle, col-md-12'>
                <h2>Any other musings?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class='col-md-12'>
                <p>
                    I had to google the meaning of musings. As contemplation; reflection. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think, from the first chapter, the book is quite repetitive. I got the point - Meditation is good and proven as good, so let's keep good attention on our breathings. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On another side, I have sometimes felt a little bit offended by some parts - for exemple saying that Happiness is the default state of mind felt like turning down all the depression issue. Yes, meditation can help and improve a lot of areas, but making such universal statements is a little bit jawring to me...
