                    I know meditation to be a very nice practice - a very resting one and calming one. I personnaly use meditation from time to time to focus my attention or calm myself when I feel like my heart is beating too fast.
                    But having been the main retail seller in a meditation self well being lifestyle shop in France, I develloped for meditation a hate/love relationship. I think a lot of the sayings about being a meditator are tacky and a lot on a trendy show-off lifestyle. I like everyone to keep their individuality and I saw a lot of meditator caricatures coming to me, just to spread their knowledge. The concept of meditating as an answer to anything and having a wise and slow graps of life is not appealing to me. That is the predjudice I have about meditation.

                <h2>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class='col-md-12'>
                <p>
                    I would not say that I learnt new things. 
                    But giving it a fair go, I realized that some things that I would do as to "fit in" my own view of medidation could definitively be broaden and that I was treating the subject with definitively some ressentment related to too much exposure in a work environment.

                    For exemple, I would always prefer to close my eyes to meditate. I always get distracted easily, so not having a visual distration helps. Via this chapter, I get that it is totally ok not to focus <em>*hard*</em>. So I let myself try open eyes meditation - I still feel self conscious in the practice, so being able to be eyes open is a good thing to try a little practice on a bench in a busy street - It doesn't make me rest as easily but it is another path.

                <h2>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class='col-md-12'>
                <p>
                    I had heard of the powerful mountain image before - it always make me giggle and I like it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the author's suggestion of a mid open eyes mediation as being the best option - I decided to try both closed (that I used to do) and open eyed meditation according to situation and this resulted in a new view of the practice that really stand out for me.

                <h2>Any other musings?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class='col-md-12'>
                <p>
                    I had to google the meaning of musings. As contemplation; reflection. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think, from the first chapter, the book is quite repetitive. I got the point - Meditation is good and proven as good, so let's keep good attention on our breathings. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On another side, I have sometimes felt a little bit offended by some parts - for exemple saying that Happiness is the default state of mind felt like turning down all the depression issue. Yes, meditation can help and improve a lot of areas, but making such universal statements is a little bit jawring to me...
