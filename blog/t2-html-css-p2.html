                <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class='twelve columns'>
                <p>
                    Grid based design sounds like the box model, but on the CSS vision of things. It consists on breaking websites into grids of 12 columns. A few grid systems are more popular than others. A smaller on the left and larger on the right is quite popular. Two, Three, Four columns is quite common as well. Having a total of 12 columns allows you to fit those popular options : that is why most of the grids systems use 12 columns. With thoses classes we can better control the overall layout of the webpage.

                <h2>What is all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class='twelve columns'>
                <p>
                    Today we have many devices to access the internet - it means a lot a variation on screen size (resolution in pixels is what we care about). The property max-width : ...px makes sure that the page will probably look great on every device, but it would need to be centered. Responsive design works with percentages or with the unit we discovered on <a href="./t1-html-css-dom-p1">'em'</a>.

                <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class='twelve columns'>
                <p>
                    The semantic structure refers to tags that will be recognised by both computers and humans. We can think of headers h1...h4, image img or the form form. Concerning the header tag, which often refers to titles, it is important to think that the size of text is not the one that matter, because sizing is only styling, what matters is the importance (or structure) of it in the page to be read by the browser on the DOM.

                <h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on :</h2>
            </div>
            <div class='twelve columns'>
                <ul>
                    <li class='list'>.row {display:flex; flex-wrap :wrap;}</li>
                    <p>
                        As a property to be sure to align your columns and not stack them on top of each other.
                    </p>
                    <li class='list'>element{overflow:auto;}</li>
                    <p>
                        As a property is a pretty nive feature because it allows you to contain a lot of text in a small area where you can scroll up/down inside the element but not scrolling the whole page. It is visualy satisfying to be able to do that.
                    </p>
                    <li class='list'>@media only screen and (max-width; 300px){p{property;...;}</li>
                    <p>
                        This is a beautiful option ! From what my grasp was of this, the @media forms a media query which allows you to change the CSS properties depending on the devices resolution we are reding it from.
                    </p>
                    <li class='list'>normalize.css</li>
                    <p>
                        With many many browsers your website may not look the same and be interpreted the same through its different uses. Adding the link : <pre>&ltlink rel="stylesheet" src="//normalize-css.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/noralize.css"&gt</pre>  to the head of your document you make sure that every browser will interpret your page the same way. This gives me comfort.
