        <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
        <p>
            I learnt that we can train our brains. From this chapter I will remember two main points that really struck me.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class='list'>The base level of emotion</li>
            <p>
                Everyone has a basic level of emotional state. Without any emotional input we live on this basic level that is individual to each person. What this chapter made me think more about is how we can actually train our brain to move this basic feeling towards a happier state. This is very appealing to me as I often tend to think that to feel happier, I need to do things that are going to change my overall mood, but then I depend on those activities and I put myself on high dependancy on how that goes. Trying to change an overall state by meditation and mindfullness is a good point that I can see myself trying out.
            </p>
            <li class='list'>"Paying attention moment to moment without judging"</li>
            <p>
                I felt like this quote is sonething I should think about a little bit further. Practicing guided meditation as part of the "Time and Habits" side of the curriculum I notice that I would often judge my practice while doing it. Simple directions as "notice the movement of your breath" drives me to analyse some respiration patterns and overthinking it. I sometimes end up thinking "in - out" but miss out on paying attention to the moment itself. This is a notion I will have to refine with pratice and find a way to notice something without analysing it, or paying attention without judging>
            </p>
        </ul>

        <h3> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
        <p>
            I personnaly didn't really enjoyed the "engeenering humor" of the author, but I do get his point. I enjoy being able to introduce emotional thinking and mindfullness without making it too big as a lifestyle. Two minutes is a time that feels manageable, but help getting more focus and rest when feeling overwhelmed. I feel like a two minutes mindfullness time would be something that I would use as a tool when in need, more than a regular habit.
