                            We all use very different tools to access content on the internet. I don't so much know about you, but I often wake-up with my phone (as I grab it to turn off the alarm - or check the time) I then go on to social media, or some of the news I want to check from a probably 300px wide device. Then when the day start I go for my computer. My personnal use is the tinier the screen - the lighter the device. And I like light. My husband is a designer, he like huge and wide screen. everybody has their own confort - their own use of applications and those applications have to fit everyone preferences and show their best for everyone. Adaptation is responsiveness. 
                            It is important to be able to target a wider audience.

                            Mobile first is setting the CSS or choosing a framework that would consider a tiny screen first and formost than a wide display. The base thinking in this design is that the smaller the screen, the less the power of processing. Putting the information for smaller screen let them not have to read the whole length of the code but only stop at what concern them. Bigger screen on the other end are probably tablets, laptop or even desktops, they are backed up with much more power than the phone (at our time at least) so they can go the whole way going through code for mobile design, not displaying it until they see some property that concern them.

                            Frameworks are a standardisation of often faced common issues in the developping world. You have a lot of them and all of them are more or less focussed in some specific issues. The framework provide a standardized code to support a nice looking website which will have a nicer head start than other ones starting from scratch (because in the case of Bootstrap or Skeleton for exemple the developper team won't have to write an extra bit of code to define the columns for a nice grid/canvas to put websites elements in...). 
                            Frameworks are bits and tricks to not have to do everything from scratch, they are not like a CMS, where you get the whole thing nearly done elsewhere - they are more like getting dried pasta for your meal when you could make them from scratch. With frameworks you are not going the extra little bit of way, but you do get a good help on cooking your own meal.

                            A wireframe is a scheme of the website with the contents sorted out as boxes. It helps designing the overall aesthetic of the website without having to care about the contents definition. It helps with defining a powerful design structure as well because the wireframe is in black and white (no colors are involved - as such, the elements are highlighted by their position more than their looks).

                            I think I wanted to see my website as a dynamic page - which I can't really do without implementing some Javascript (I think) which I don't know how to control properly at the moment. In the application of my wireframes I had to divert from the first plans, to simplify the redesign. I will keep the redesigning of the website as a work in progress.
