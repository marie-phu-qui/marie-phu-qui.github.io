    <h1>Changing your habits to be more productive</h1>
    <h2>Meditation, mindfulness, pomodoro method... </h2>
    <p>	•	Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</p>
    <p><em>On Tuesday 20th February 2018, I downloaded the app <em>Headspace</em>, 
    to try it out. I am very interested in mediation in the idea of it 
    and I have been retailing “well-being, meditative” products for the 
    past year and half - but in the actual commitment to it I just struggle 
    seeing myself becoming a daily meditator. Even if I know the benefits of it.
    It doesn’t feel like my lifestyle 
    (like I know how much I love waking up early and 
    how it makes me feel good, but I still sleep-in when I can). 
    It maybe because, at this point, I haven’t hit the spot and I am not doing 
    it right. Or I try to do too much when I decide to do it, instead of 
    developing a tiny healthy habit.
    This is why I decided to download the app - because it 
    engage you for 10 minutes a day and it will be a shame to let 
    my grey matter brain go to waste when I can help it.</em></p>

    <p>	•	What did you find interesting?</p>
    <p><em>I have always been more attracted to guided meditation as having a voice
        feels more inclusive and binds me to come back to it. Having a planned 
        schedule as well and a "see you tomorrow" type of relationship helps me
        to feel commited to it.
    </p>
    <p>In other ways, I find myself often overwhelmed by project. Because I think 
        they are big. The "starting small" vision resonnate a lot on what way 
        of rethinking the steps would help me achieve them.</em></p>

    <p>	•	What worked for you?</p>
    <p><em>I can't really say at this point what "works", I do know that I am a 
        creature of habit and I respond strongly to them. But I often box them to
        a specific period of time. If I loose my commitment to it it becomes much 
        harder to come back to it.</em>
    </p>

    <p>	•	Which will you experiment further with?</p>
    <p><em>I am definitively going to give every technique a try and see how confortably I 
        respond to their use. I do want to take time in trying them respectively.
    </p>
    <p>The Pomodoro method and the "zone" or "flow", are the ones that are the least attractive 
        to me as I seem to work confortably on chunks of 50 minutes. The "zone"
        goes as far as scaring me. It sounds more like trying to loosen 
        mindfull focus and reflection on a subject and trust that an 
        over-confident code writing will be brilliant at the end. From my 
        former experience it is often a very nice feeling for me at the 
        time but does not result in a project that is as good as it felt it 
        should be.</p></em></p>
