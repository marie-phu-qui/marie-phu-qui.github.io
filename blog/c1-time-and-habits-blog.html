                    On Tuesday 20th February 2018, I downloaded the app <em>Headspace</em>, to try it out. I am very interested in mediation in the idea of it and I have been retailing “well-being, meditative” products for the past year and half - but in the actual commitment to it I just struggle seeing myself becoming a daily meditator. Even if I know the benefits of it. It doesn’t feel like my lifestyle (like I know how much I love waking up early and how it makes me feel good, but I still sleep-in when I can). It maybe because, at this point, I haven’t hit the spot and I am not doing it right. Or I try to do too much when I decide to do it, instead of developing a tiny healthy habit.This is why I decided to download the app - because it engage you for 10 minutes a day and it will be a shame to let my grey matter brain go to waste when I can help it.

                    I have always been more attracted to guided meditation as having a voice feels more inclusive and binds me to come back to it. Having a planned schedule as well and a "see you tomorrow" type of relationship helps me to feel commited to it.<br>In other ways, I find myself often overwhelmed by project. Because I think they are big. The "starting small" vision resonnate a lot on what way of rethinking the steps would help me achieve them.

                    I can't really say at this point what "works", I do know that I am a creature of habit and I respond strongly to them. But I often box them to a specific period of time. If I loose my commitment to it it becomes much harder to come back to it.

                    I am definitively going to give every technique a try and see how confortably I respond to their use. I do want to take time in trying them respectively.<br>The Pomodoro method and the "zone" or "flow", are the ones that are the least attractive to me as I seem to work confortably on chunks of 50 minutes. The "zone" goes as far as scaring me. It sounds more like trying to loosen mindfull focus and reflection on a subject and trust that an over-confident code writing will be brilliant at the end. From my former experience it is often a very nice feeling for me at the time but does not result in a project that is as good as it felt it should be.
