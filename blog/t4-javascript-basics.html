            <h2>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class='ten columns'>
            <p>
                It is a language which control the end result. I feel like it does not compare so much to HTML, but some features are achievable both via CSS or Javascript.

                Javascript in comparison would always be triggered via a user input.When HTML and CSS are a fully controled display of information

            <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h2>

            <p>
                Control flow resonate to me kinda like the CSS cascading logic. Except it is not the same, the reading of the Javascript code is linear from top to bottom, but the execution have to be executed entirely to go further - which can involve looping for a while or getting sent to another direction in the means to resolve a called function. 
                The order of execution of the code then matters a lot to be able to read the data properly. Exactly like speech, the control flow resonate to me like putting some sense in a story. The way things/data are ordered matter.
                Loops, as for the for loop it would be a proccess of for 5 minutes brush teeth, as long as the 5 minutes are not done keep brushing.
                As for the while loop it would be a logic as while (as long as)teeth are dirty, brush teeth (with checking every loop is teeth state of cleanliness have changed).

            <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class='ten columns'>
            <p>
                Arrays are defined with number to access them. You have to know the order of the items in the array to be able to access them.
                Objects are labelled with classifiers to be accessed.

            <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class='ten columns'>
            <p>
                Function are doing a specific action when called. They are useful when there is a need a repetitive action. They help us not having to write the same code over and over but simply calling this one process.
