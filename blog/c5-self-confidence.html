        <h2>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h2>

        <p>
            Mindfullness is related to selfawareness in being close to synonyms in the book.
            My own take in their relationship would be that mindfullness is feeling councious of every aspect of things happening around you, being able to focus on details as much as having a view of the broad picture. Self awareness would be close to it but secluded to the 'self' so being able to know yourself as a whole, but as in the practice of Body Scanning being able to pick individual parts of yourself to check it in.

        <h2>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h2>
      </div>

        <p>
            <em>Body Scan</em> : I tried to follow the exercise of body scanning provided in te chapter. I don't quite feel like I have enough self awareness to use it efficiently - but as predicted by the author of Search Inside Yourself, I indeed fell assleep. So I guess, I am in between doing it right and doing it wrong in the practice. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Journaling</em> : (written under App stress) I started the journaling process with an app that I heard about a little while ago ' write or die' I initially wanted to go for the Flowstate one but it only was designed for Mac OS. What is interresting about this app is that you set a goal of writing time and so you HAVE TO write during this timing period (you can also set a word count per minute) if you fail this objective then you writing gets lost. What is good about it is setting a 'stressing' environment but also it lets me not think about what I write as I HAVE to write something, many ideas that I would have discarded for non important are the ones that I would reach to, or give access to my mind because I need something - anything - not to loose the file I am writing. 
            On a side note, I used to keep a daily note of what made me happy today and I want to get back to it. It help keeping track of a positive aspect of everyday and it gives depth to life events.

            <h2>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h2>

            <p>
                I feel good about to difference between 'I am happy' and 'I feel happy'. I see the language switch as very meaningfull. 
                I do think that the switch to 'My body is experiencing happiness' is taking it a step to far for me. 
                Yes, the body is different to the mind, but they are linked and when somebody asks 'how are you today' it is quite unlikely that they want to know more about what your body is experiencing than how your mind is dealing with it. At least, that is not the answer I would expect when I ask someone how they are going.
