            <p>
                The problem I was facing was getting my CSS in a whole harmony together.<br>
                There are a few problems that were faced then. Main one being me, I really was having a hard time cutting down my vision of the size of the work I had to complete and think it as smaller tasks.<br> 
                On the technical part, I struggled a lot to implement a screen responsive toggling index of my blog and tech pages. I started trying something out, but it didn't go well. I kept getting odd effects that I didn't inderstand at all. Even googling was making it hard as didn't quite know what I was after or where to begin. So I took a step back, for me peusocoding the process is a good method to organise my thinking as well. It made me realize that I was trying to move an element from one place to another, which I didn't know how to do. What I knew how to do was to make an element appear for one screen size and disappear for another.<br>
                Having settled to this new way of thinking my process, I decided to go for it.<br>
                As I often code from the 'computing room' that I share with my graphic designer husband I use the rubber ducky method on him often, even somethimes when he is not around I will start thinking about how I would present what my issue is - and putting words on process I find out my answer myself often leaving him someway rudely mid sentence. <br>
                Throughout the process I felt quite frustrated, and the whole way I should admit that I kept thinking that there has to be a better way. I just committed to the one I found because it worked and I expected to find a lighter way with more grid knowledge and experience.<br>
                I learnt to let go of the feeling of frustration when I am sure there is a better way - but I got to keep going to avoid feeling sick of a single problem.                    
            </p>
            <li class='list'>Solved a problem in an elegant way :</li>
            <p>
                All the problems that I can think of that I 'solved in an elegant way' are problems that I just breezed through the most recently in the eloquent-2.js- to breeze through it it means that I just immediately used some of the methods like 'pseudocoding' or 'trying something out' and : it just worked.<br>
                I do think that when it just works there is this less memorable type of experience. I have no memory of techniques when there is no struggle. <br>
                But when I reach for peer or coaches help, I don't know if it is because for me this is a feeling of 'last resort/I can't figure it out on my own' or because the human interraction has more inprint on my memory because it is presented with different words than the ones I would use on myself, but thoses problem solving got written in deep memory for me.

        <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process : Pseudocode - Trying something - Rubber ducky method - Reading error messages - Console.logging - Googling - Asking your peers for help - Asking coaches for help - Improving your process with reflection.</h2>
      </div>
      <div class='twelve columns'>
        <p>
            I feel quite confident on being able to tackle problems on my own as googling an issue often gives a direclty coded answer. <br>
            As for learning from it, I tackle problems the best pseudocoding the process I want to achieve or vocally expressing what I am doing (I don't have a rubber ducky, but this would go to this method if I had). As for reading error messages    I do comfortably this in my problem solving path (or feel confident to google the error message). <br>
            I don't have the direct reflex to go for console.logging - I do think that it is going a little bit further to write console.log() and if I am stuck I don't often know where. I feel like when I do get stuck it is more on the process of realisation of something. As not knowing how to start of do as a whole, more than having a code error sneaking in. When I feel like I do have a bug sneaked in I do try to go for a debugging style problem solving. But it hasn't been a full success for me at the moment (I used it for the eloquent-2.js chessboard problem quite a lot nonetheless).
